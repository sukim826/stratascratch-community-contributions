# Strata Scratch Community Template
A template to upload your analytics created using the available datasets on Strata Scratch.

## Repo Folder/File Structure
1. Name your repo anything you'd like but make sure to include the table name for reference. For example, if you analyzed datasets.yelp_reviews, then your repo might be called "An analysis of yelp_reviews".
2. The README.md file is where your questions, code, visualizations, and answers are placed. At a minimum, it should include:
    * the names of the database table(s) being analyzed
    * a description of the dataset
    * questions and analytical topics
    * code
    * visualizations
3. Save your graphs in a folder named "visualizations". Visualizations should be linked to the README.md.

## Instructions on Formatting and Style
1. Formatting like headers, bulletpoints, etc can be found in the Markdown Style Guide in the References section below.
2. To embed your code, you will also need to use Markdown language. It should look something like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM datasets.yelp_reviews
```
Refer to the Markdown Style guide or click on "Edit" in this README to see how the code above was embedded.

3. To link a visualization, your visualization needs to be in .jpg, .png, or some other image format and placed into the "visualizations" folder. You will then link the image in the README.md by specifying the path ((visualizations/stratascratch.jpg). Refer to the Markdown Style Guide below or click on "Edit" in this README to see how the top image was emebedded.
